In addition to buying new books, registered users can also sell their 
old books, which will be visible to all users of the application.

When 
logged in, admin has his own separate page that is 
responsible for maintaining the application, maintaining the
database, as well as add new books, update books and delete them, or change the status of the book to inactive, which means that users cannot buy it at the moment
